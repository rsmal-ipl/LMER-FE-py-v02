On an ocean, white,
Of roaring waves,
I see your light
In golden fades.
A precious gift
Of your longing arms
Hurt me not
Just sing to me, my love.
Calm! how calm! so,
So sweetly, child, you sing
And all the joy you bring to me, comes,
Cause our loved ones hold.
And I will, I will be waiting
On an ocean.
Sweetly, child, you sing
On an ocean,
On an ocean,
So calm, song.
